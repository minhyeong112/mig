        I had always wanted to do muscle-ups, but was stuck for a very long time until I finally figured them out.  These are the lessons that I learned along the way. <br><br>

        1. Pull-ups and muscle-ups are very different.  I thought that if I did a lot of strict pulls-ups, I would naturally progress to doing muscle-ups.  Not true at all.  I could do multiple weighted pull-ups (as in +30kg) without being able to do a single muscle-up.
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/weightedPU.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>

        2. Muscle-ups are 95% technique and muscle memory.  Jumping muscle-ups from a low bar help develop this muscle memory.
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/jumpingMU.mp4" type="video/mp4">

            </video>
        </div>

        3. Not exactly sure why, but bouldering/rock-climbing REALLY helps unlock muscle-ups.  Climbing had the effect that I expected pull-ups to have.
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/climbing.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/firstcleanmu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>

        4. Before moving on to the rings, make bar muscle-ups as clean as possible.  Focus on not swinging at all at the bottom.
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/cleanmus.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>

        5. Resistance bands are the only way that I was able to work technique/muscle memory.  I would have never unlocked the ring muscle up without resistance bands.
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/bandringmu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/firstringmu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>

        6. Weighted pull-ups make you stronger.  Weighted muscle-ups simply force you to use the correct technique.
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/weightedbarmu.mp4" type="video/mp4">

            </video>
        </div>
        <div class="video-container">
            <video controls>
                <source src="muvids/weightedringmu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>
