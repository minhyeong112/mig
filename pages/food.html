        This has been my experience trying out different diets:<br><br>

        <b><u>Generally "healthy"</u></b><br>
        I was fortunate to grow up eating mostly home-cooked meals.<br>
        <div class="tools-container">
            <div class="tools-column">
              Pro
                <li>never understood why others preferred fast food</li>
            </div>
            <div class="tools-column">
              Con
                <li>couldn't stop eating (normal for a kid)</li>
            </div>
          </div><br>

          <b><u>Vegan</u></b><br>
          Back in college, a guy came and give a talk about how anyone who isn't vegan is basically crazy. I figured I'd give it a shot purely out of curiosity.<br>
          <div class="tools-container">
              <div class="tools-column">
                Pro
                  <li>gained appreciation for a variety of vegetables</li>
              </div>
              <div class="tools-column">
                Con
                  <li>made it 1 month before feeling constant fatigue</li>
              </div>
            </div><br>

            <b><u>Lots and lots of raw fish</u></b><br>
            After college, my first job was in Okinawa, Japan.  Sushi and sashimi are cheap, fresh, and delicious there!<br>
          <div class="tools-container">
              <div class="tools-column">
                Pro
                  <li>ate a variety of raw fish basically everyday or every other day</li>
              </div>
              <div class="tools-column">
                Con
                  <li>developed kidney stones after a few years, which I now think was because of this diet</li>
              </div>
            </div><br>

            <b><u>Raw Foods + Juicing</u></b><br>
            After hearing about  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drqilove/" target="_blank">Dr. Love's diet</a>, I decided to give it a shot.<br>
          <div class="tools-container">
              <div class="tools-column">
                Pro

              </div>
            </div><br>

            <b><u>Fruitarian</u></b><br>
            After reading <a href="https://a.co/d/0a0N0jko" target="_blank">80/10/10 by Dr. Graham</a>, I decided to give it a shot. I actually still practice this every so often for about a week at a time for all the benefits of fasting without any of the difficulty. Not sustainable as a long term diet but still great short term.<br>

              </div>
            </div><br>

            <b><u>Carnivore</u></b><br>
            After hearing about <a href="https://liondiet.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Peterson's diet</a>, especially since he's not particularly interested in nutrition, I decided to give it a shot.<br>
          <div class="tools-container">
              <div class="tools-column">
                Pros
                  <li>delicious food</li>

              <div class="tools-column">
                Con
                <li>difficult to stay hydrated</li>  
              </div>
            </div><br>

            <b><u>My current diet</u></b><br>
            Incorporating lessons learned from all of the above, I now eat very simple meals made with very few ingredients. I typically don't eat breakfast, but usually have some pu-erh tea.  Whenever I first get hungry in the middle of the day, I usually eat a meal made up of one type of fruit (example: 7 oranges).  When I get hungry at the end of the day, I'll eat some kind of meat cooked just enough to be safe to eat (example: rare steak), seasoned only with salt, with 3-5 poached eggs, with an avocado/some spinach/tomato/sweet potato on the side.  Have stopped eating rice, pasta, and the like.  That being said, if I'm in a social setting I'll discreetly try to stick to this but don't really care if I have to deviate every once in a while.  So I follow this diet about 95% of the time, and the reason why I do it is because I feel great doing it!<br>
