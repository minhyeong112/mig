    <p><p>I'm Miguel.  <br>I love trying new experiences, solving problems, and spending time with other humans.  <br>I'm a loyal friend, an over-thinker, and a slow packer.  I get excited easily, smile a lot and have a very high stress-tolerance.  <br>I became a math nerd at a <a href="https://usna.edu/homepage.php">weird school</a>, and have lived/worked in Okinawa, Seoul, and Baghdad. </p></p>

            <p>Just got back from 6 months in Baghdad, currently in California working with <a href="https://www.marines.com/">very inspiring people</a>. <br>Making arrangements to <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGD222ogns/OuTuM2YTUrEM6I5lGd51FQ/view?utm_content=DAGD222ogns&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor">transition</a> to the digital nomad life later this year.  <br>With the help of our <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">virtual friend</a>, software development (albeit at a very amateur level) is very exciting to me these days.  <br>For the first time in my life, I'm feeling a very strong calling towards entrepreneurship and am happily spending 100% of my "free-time" gaining skills and building on ideas. </p>

            <p>1. If I find myself wasting time on a mobile app, I immediately delete the app.  If I really want to use the app/service, I can just use my laptop, but the added inconvenience (i.e. my own laziness) usually solves the problem. <br>2. I charge my phone in a different room. <br>3. While I love listening to podcasts, I realized that the best content came from that person's book.  So I stopped listening to all podcasts and listen to audiobooks instead.  </p>
